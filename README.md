Maintainer: Robert Ladwig


## About

Creates a container that enables your machine to run **the latest GLM-AED2 version** (currently 3.0.0) without downloading or compiling it by yourself. 

The hydrobert/glm-aed2 container (https://hub.docker.com/r/hydrobert/glm-aed2) is based on the jsta/GLM_docker container. Original docker image and code by Joseph Stachelek (https://github.com/jsta/GLM_docker).


# How to run it:
A tutorial PDF-file is located under example/docker_glmaed2_minitutorialR.pdf, which explains the basic steps on how to run this docker container.
You can also find a Rstudio example that downloads all data and runs a simulation under example/run_docker_glmaed.R.
